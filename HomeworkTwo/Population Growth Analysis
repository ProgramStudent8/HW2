%a) Create a row vector 'population'
population = [5000, 5200, 5350, 5600, 5800];
%Note- I listed all of the given values in a row vector


%b) Calculate the year-over-year growth rate
growth_rate = NaN(1, length(population)); 
for i = 2:length(population)
    growth_rate(i) = (population(i) - population(i-1)) / population(i-1) * 100; 
end 
%Note- I ininitalized the growth_rate vector with NaN


%c) Create a 2x5 matrix pop_data
population_data = [population; growth_rate]; 
%Note- I combined population and growth rates


%d) Print the formatted table     
disp('Year    Population    Growth Rate (%)');
disp('-------------------------------------');

for year = 1:length(population)
    if year == 1
        % For the first year, there is no growth rate, so print 'N/A'
        fprintf('%-7d %-12d N/A\n', year, population(year));
    else
        % For other years, print the population and growth rate
        fprintf('%-7d %-12d %.2f\n', year, population(year), growth_rate(year));
    end
end
% Note- Print the first year's data with "N/A" for growth rate, then the
% second-fifth years data with their growth rates
